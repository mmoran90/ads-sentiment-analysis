Even based of the tittle alone one can make such an assumption. On the recerve, the 3 songs with the lowest sentiment score are \"Criminal Intent\", \"Don't Fucking Tell Me What To Do\", and \"I Walk On Guilded Splinters\". Similarly, I believe it is the theme that is driving such score.\n",

    "A: For Robyn, the 3 songs with the highest sentiment scores are \"Love is Free\", \"Indestructible\", and \"U Should Know Better\".

On the recerve, the 3 songs with the lowest sentiment score are \"Criminal Intent\", and \"Don't Fucking Tell Me What To Do\".
