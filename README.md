## Sentiment Analysis of Song Lyrics & Twitter Data

This project conducts a comprehensive sentiment analysis of song lyrics and Twitter data to examine emotional tones associated with two artists. Using natural language processing, it identifies average sentiment scores, highlights each artist's most positive and negative songs, and investigates audience sentiment by analyzing emoji usage in follower tweets. 

The project provides Python code and Jupyter Notebooks for data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and visualizing results, offering insights into how lyrics and audience reactions reflect artists' emotional impact.
